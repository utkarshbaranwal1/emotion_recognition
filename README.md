emotion recognition on RAVDESS data using CNN

data can be downloaded from https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/

The data contains speech from both male and female, but in this project I choose to work with only male data because of simplicity thus, in addition to emotion classification, the model can also be classified into gender class as per the requirements.

Emotions of class which were trained on are - 1.calm 2.happy 3.sad 4.fearful 5.angry

Final model and weight file are also attached in the repo.
