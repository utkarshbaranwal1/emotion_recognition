emotion recognition on RAVDESS data using CNN

data can be downloaded from https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess/
The data contains speech from both male and female, but in this project I choose to work with both data regardless of gender thus, in addition to emotion classification, the model also classifies into gender class.
Emotions of class which were trained on are - 1.calm 2.happy 3.sad 4.fearful 5.angry
